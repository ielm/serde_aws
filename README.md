# Serde AWS

** Serde is a framework for *ser*ializing and *de*serializing Rust data structures efficiently and
generically. `serde_aws` is a crate that wraps AWS SDK types for easy serialization and
deserialization. 

At the moment, only AWS Comprehend Medical types are implemented, as I'm using this for a specific
project, but feature parity with the AWS Rust SDK is a long-term goal.
